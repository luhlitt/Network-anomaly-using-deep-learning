# Network-anomaly-detection-using-deep-learning
The idea of this project is to use deep learning models to strengthen malware detection. The experiment was carried out using the CIC IDS 2017 dataset.

Access to the dataset can be found here. https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

For this experiment all files were combined into one csv file.
