# Network-anomaly-detection-using-deep-learning
The idea of this project is to use deep learning models for malware detection. The experiment was carried out using the CIC IDS 2017 dataset.

Access to the dataset can be found here. https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

All files were combined into one file for use in this experiment.
